Your UI should closely follow the provided design on figma – you may use different images
for the profile picture and events.
• The app bar needs to be built in flutter, it can’t be an image.
• Your design must have a single page, with the posts, comments, and stats sections being
changed only according to what the user selects – the whole page must not be rebuilt.
• The list of events and comments needs to be scrollable.
